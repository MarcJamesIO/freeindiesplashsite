# freeindiesplashsite

This is a simple starter splash site for free indie games. It's a static site that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is not a full-fledged website and doesn't really conform to any best practices. It's just a simple way to get a splash site up and running quickly.

Get it up and running:

1. Clone the repo or download the code

2. Open the project in your favorite code editor

3. Add your assets to the fonts and images folders

4. Update the index.html file with your game's information

5. Update the press-kit.html file with your game's information

6. Update the styles.css file with your game's colors and fonts

7. Update the styles-pk.css file with your game's colors and fonts

8. Don't forget to add the correct URL's to all the social links

9. Get your own favicon using https://realfavicongenerator.net/ and replace the favicons in the root

10. Find a cheap webhost, buy a domain and upload the files
